First, there is no UI (User interface), it was thought about at begining, but there are more important thinks, like live itself :) But do not wory, MonitorUI does great job and it has sneaky notifications via mail and very nice logs. Who wants another dashboard when you can integrate with such great tool like Grafana, Kibana etc ... Also it does prety nice color outputs on terminal (so your eyes will not be lost in shadows).

## Ok, stop talking, now what Monitor~~UI~~ can do for you ?
